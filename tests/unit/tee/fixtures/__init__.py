"""Offline TEE attestation test corpus.

Four real ``GET /tee/attestation`` responses captured live from the Venice API
on 2026-06-04 (capture epoch :data:`CAPTURE_EPOCH`), one per ``e2ee-*`` model in
:data:`FIXTURE_SLUGS`. Each ``attestation_<slug>.json`` wraps the full server
response under ``"attestation"`` plus the exact ``"_client_nonce"`` the client
sent (the REPORTDATA binding needs it) and the ``"_capture_epoch"`` the
collateral was fetched at.

A fifth capture, ``attestation_live_evidence.json``, uses the current
``attestation.evidence`` wire shape and has its own capture epoch
:data:`EVIDENCE_CAPTURE_EPOCH`.

Each capture has its **own** ``collateral_<slug>.json`` snapshot
(:class:`dcap_qvl.QuoteCollateralV3` ``to_json()``). Collateral is per-capture,
NOT per-FMSPC: all four quotes share FMSPC ``90C06F000000`` / ``ca=platform`` /
TDX v4, yet their PCK certificate chains differ (different physical platforms),
so a single shared collateral fails QE-report signature verification on two of
the four. Tests must pair each capture with its matching collateral.

Freeze ``now_secs`` to :data:`CAPTURE_EPOCH` in every test: the TCB-info /
QE-identity collateral carries a validity window, and a real wall-clock
``now_secs`` would make the committed snapshots "expire".
