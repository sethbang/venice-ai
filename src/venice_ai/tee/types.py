    Captures the fields the baseline verifier needs plus the retained raw
    attestation evidence (Intel TDX quote, NVIDIA payload, server-side
    verification report) for an optional :class:`FullQuoteVerifier` extension.

    The live response carries many provider-specific keys (``info``,
    ``event_log``, ``tee_provider``, ``tee_hardware``, ``upstream_model``,
    ``nonce_source``, ``candidates_*``, ...). We override the inherited
    ``extra="forbid"`` with ``extra="allow"`` so future / provider-specific
    fields are retained rather than rejected.

    Attributes:
        verified: The server's verification claim. The baseline verifier
            fails closed if this is ``False``.
        signing_public_key: 130-hex uncompressed model key. This IS the model's
            ECDH/encryption key (no separate enc key). May be ``None`` for plain
            TEE models that do not publish a model signing key.
        signing_address: 20-byte Ethereum-style address derived from the
            signing key, used in the report-data binding.
        signing_algo: Always ``"ecdsa"``.
        nonce: The nonce echoed by the server; the verifier checks it equals
            :attr:`sent_nonce`.
        sent_nonce: The nonce the client sent (NOT part of the wire response;
            populated by the verifier for the equality / binding check).
        intel_quote / quote: Raw Intel TDX quote hex (retained for full
            quote verification).
        nvidia_payload: Raw NVIDIA GPU attestation payload (retained).
        server_verification: The server's own verification report (retained).
