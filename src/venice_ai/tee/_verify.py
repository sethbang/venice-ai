"""Full client-side Intel TDX quote verification (``[e2ee-verify]`` extra).

The baseline verifier (:mod:`venice_ai.tee._attestation`) trusts Venice's
server-side ``verified`` claim. :class:`DcapTdxVerifier` closes that gap: it
verifies the raw Intel TDX quote's ECDSA signature and PCK certificate chain to
a **pinned** Intel SGX Root CA, evaluates the FMSPC TCB status against
Intel-signed collateral, confirms the enclave is non-debug, that the E2EE
signing key is bound into REPORTDATA, that the event log replays to the quoted
RTMRs, and that the dstack ``app_compose`` hashes into the quoted
``mr_config_id`` — all OFFLINE.

**Security tier.** By default this proves the model runs on a *genuine,
non-debug Intel TDX enclave* running a *self-consistent dstack workload* (Tier
B). It does **not** independently confirm this is the legitimate Venice
image/app unless the caller supplies ``expected_measurements`` /
``expected_compose_hash`` from a source independent of the Venice endpoint
(per-dimension Tier A).

**Wire schemas.** Both the original dstack layout and the current
``attestation.evidence`` layout are accepted (see
:mod:`venice_ai.tee._evidence`). The current wire carries neither
``app_compose`` nor ``compose_hash``, so compose identity cannot be
established from the attestation alone; ``last_result["checks"]
["compose_binding"]`` is then the string ``"unavailable"`` rather than
``True``. Tier B on that wire therefore proves genuine non-debug TDX
hardware, a signing key bound into the enclave, and an event log consistent
with the quoted RTMRs — but not that the workload matches a given compose.
Pin ``expected_measurements["mr_config_id"]`` for that dimension. Because a
check value may be a string, test results with ``is True``, never for
truthiness.

**The #1 correctness gate.** ``dcap_qvl.parse_quote`` performs **no** signature
check, so every policy byte (debug bit, REPORTDATA, RTMRs, ``mr_config_id``) is
trustworthy ONLY after ``verify_with_root_ca`` has PASSED for the same raw
quote. :meth:`DcapTdxVerifier.verify` enforces that ordering: the crypto gate
runs first and any failure aborts before a single parsed byte is consulted.

``dcap-qvl`` is an **optional** dependency (the ``[e2ee-verify]`` extra). This
module imports cleanly on a bare install; the import happens lazily inside
:func:`_require_dcap`, which raises a clear :class:`TeeError` with an install
hint when the extra is absent. **It never silently skips** — a silent skip would
degrade to baseline trust and defeat the entire feature (fail-closed).

    Holds collateral / pinned root / measurement policy as constructor state and
    reads the evidence off the attestation. :meth:`verify` is **synchronous and
    offline** (it never touches the network); collateral is *injected*, either
    directly or via the async :meth:`with_fetched_collateral` factory.

    **Checks may not be bool.** The ``"checks"`` mapping in :attr:`last_result`
    usually holds ``bool`` values, but ``checks["compose_binding"]`` may instead
    be the string ``"unavailable"`` when the wire cannot establish compose
    identity (see :meth:`verify`). Compare with ``is True``, never for
    truthiness — the string ``"unavailable"`` is truthy in Python.

        collateral: An Intel-signed :class:`dcap_qvl.QuoteCollateralV3` (TCB info

        now_secs: Wall-clock epoch seconds for collateral validity-window checks.
            Defaults to the real current time; tests inject a frozen value. TCB
            info has a validity window, so this MUST be real in production.
        expected_measurements: Optional dict of hex reference values keyed by
            ``mrtd`` / ``rtmr0..3`` / ``mr_config_id``. Each supplied value is
            compared against the verified quote field (per-dimension Tier A).
